# Glycoseq-Cpp
GlycoSeq C++

- Glycoseq is an open source software to analyze complex glycopeptide samples using high-throughput LC-MS/MS.
- The software is capable of determining glycosylation sites on protein and identifying isomeric glycans of glycoproteins from tendem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) data (e.g. ETDhcD).
- It can be run on Linux/Mac/Windows with multi-threading support.
